Please answer the following questions about the bugs you identified and fixed:

1. **Bug Overview**: List the bugs you found and fixed. For each bug, briefly describe:

   - What was the issue?
   - How did you identify it?
   - How did you fix it?

     - useState(null) â†’ useState([])

4. **Future Prevention**: How would you prevent similar bugs in future development? Consider both coding practices and testing strategies.

5. **Learning**: What was the most challenging or interesting aspect of this bug-hunting exercise?
